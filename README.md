# Vagrant for Enterprise provisioning
  
This project is an example of how Vagrant and a virtualization provider (e.g. VirtualBox) can be used in the enterprise. 

The 2 folders would normally would be split in 2+ separate projects:

* one instance of the [enterprise-level][1] project, maintained by the organization's infrastructure team
* N instances of the [team-level][2] project, each one maintained by the different delivery teams.

You can read the detailed description about this project in this [blog post][3].
